Interesting findings:
diff -ry avr/gcc/config/avr/avr.c gcc/gcc/config/avr/avr.c:
	Most of the changes regard features missing in Tiny.
	There are quiet a few logic changes (more if ORs) regarding nmi
	/* Return nonzero if FUNC is an nmi function as specified by the "nmi" attribute.  */  
	assembly removing '*' - decl
	
	for (reg = 0; reg <= LAST_CALLEE_SAVED_REG; ++reg)          |   for (reg = 0; reg < 18; ++reg) <- #define LAST_CALLEE_SAVED_REG (AVR_TINY ? 19 : 17) 
	
	static void avr_out_plus_1  <- uses diff args!!
    const char* avr_out_plus <- uses diff args!!
	
	 const char* avr_out_fract <-- CLOBBER rounding fract, lots of steps & new code :)
	avr_out_round?
